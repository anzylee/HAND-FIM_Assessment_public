Solution Scheme == HPC  !This command specifies that you want to run TUFLOW using the HPC solution scheme or engine.
Hardware == GPU  !CPU is default. The hardware command instructs TUFLOW HPC to run using GPU hardware. This is typically orders of magnitude faster than on CPU.

Viscosity Formulation == SMAGORINSKY
Viscosity Coefficients == 0.5, 0.005
SET IWL == 224.01009732449657   ! matches the downstream WSE

Start Time == 0     ! Start Simulation at 0 hours
End Time == 10   ! End Simulation (hrs)
Timestep == 0.25     ! Use a 2D time step that is ~1/4 of the grid size in m (10 m * 0.25 -> 2.5 s)

Log Folder == Log   ! Redirects log output (eg. .tlf and _messages GIS layers to the folder log
Output Folder == ..\results\SFE_Leggett     ! Redirects results files to TUFLOW\Results\RUN
Write Check Files == ..\check\SFE_Leggett\   ! Specifies check files to be written to TUFLOW\check\RUN
Map Output Format == FLT XMDF DAT  ! Output directly to GIS (grid) as well as SMS (xmdf compact) format
Map Output Data Types == h d n V BSS    ! wse depth Manning's n velocity bed shear stress
Start Map Output == 2   ! Start map output at 4 hours
Grid Output Cell Size == 0.5
Map Output Interval == 3600    ! Output every 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
GRID Map Output Data Types == h d n V BSS
Time Series Output Interval  == 30    ! time interval of output in seconds
